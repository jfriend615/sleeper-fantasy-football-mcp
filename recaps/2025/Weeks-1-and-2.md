# ðŸŽ¤ **COMEDY ROAST OF THE STANDINGS** ðŸŽ¤

*clears throat*

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to "Check My Balls" - the league where apparently only two people know how to actually check their lineups!

At the top we have **BrownCowboy18** sitting pretty at 2-0. No team name, but hey, when you're scoring 233 points, who needs creativity? Meanwhile **ItsApollo** is also undefeated with "Jordan's Unreal Team" - and by "unreal," I think they mean "unrealistically lucky" because they've only given up 144 points! Their defense is tighter than their team name is modest.

Then we have the middle class - eight teams all thinking "Hey, we're only one game back!" **Kylashh** wants you to "Hold My Blount" while they figure out why they scored 261 points but still lost a game. That's like bringing a bazooka to a water gun fight and somehow still getting wet.

**JHarron** changed their name to "The Dicker Mans" this season - apparently "Full Chubb" wasn't working out. Sometimes a rebrand is needed when your performance is as disappointing as your previous team name.

And **truthlewis** with "Fatherless Activities ðŸ¥›" - I mean, the milk emoji really ties together the whole "daddy issues" theme. Very cohesive branding for someone sitting at .500.

Down in the basement, we have **chrisjordy's JORDY9ERS** - they're 0-2 with only 155 points total. The actual 49ers have scored more points this season, and they're terrible!

Finally, **MairedINLionsFan** is 0-2 despite scoring 212 points - which means they're the unluckiest person in fantasy football OR they're married into the Lions fanbase, which explains everything about their perpetual suffering.

*drops mic*

Thank you, you've been a wonderfully mediocre audience! ðŸŽ­
